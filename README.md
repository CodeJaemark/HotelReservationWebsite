Hotel Reservation System is a system made for booking an online reservation for hotel rooms. When a user books a reservation, they will receive an email confirmation. Aside from the booking function, users can also send a query for their concerns and questions. Users can also put ratings and make reviews on the offered by the hotel.

These data are sent to the database and are shown in the Admin Panel. Admins can view and delete the booking details, queries, and the ratings made by the users. New admin accounts can also be done in the Admin Panel.
